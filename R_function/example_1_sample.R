## Notes on using your own data to generate exposome globe
#' 1) correlation matrix
#' Â¥ou can generate correlation matrix using cor() function, e.g., cor(mtcars).
#' If you have 2 samples and the data is stored in the dataframe "sample1" and "sample2", you can run cor(sample1, sample2)
#' "sample1" and "sample2" need to have the same number of variables
#' 
#' 2) name list
#' variables are grouped in the name list
#' You can define your own group name in the list, and it will be shown in the figure
#' However, the variable names in each group must be the same as those used in corrleion matrix
#' Names and variables are shown in the figure according to the order of the names and elements in the list
#' 
#' 3) color of the track
#' The number of colors in the "trackColorList" is the same as the number of the groups
#' You can generate a set of colors easily at https://medialab.github.io/iwanthue/
#' simply providing the number of colors wanted in the color palette and click "make a palette"

## LOAD function
source("~/Downloads/chord_function.R")

## LOAD data
load("~/Downloads/fakeData.Rdata")
#' The fake correlation data is using 2 samples as the published paper (male and female of a couple)
#' corrMatrixF is the correlation matrix of 128 chemicals within females
#' corrMatrixM is the correlation matrix of 128 chemicals within males
#' corrMatrixMF is the correlation matrix of 128 chemicals between females and males (note that diagnoal is not 1)


## Create list
#' All 128 chemicals are classified into groups and are specified in the list
#' Please note that the chemicals have a suffix of "_f" or "_m" to differentiate whether it is from females or males
#' We are using the correlation matrix for females only as the example.
